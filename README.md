*Loaded Turrets* adds recipes to craft turrets with pre-filled ammo of your choice. This makes it easier to perform turret creep, requiring less microing to assault enemy bases.

Loaded turrets act the same as normal gun turrets, and when mined the result is a normal gun turret which is ready to be crafted into a loaded turret again. This means you can use pick item on them (Q), blueprint them, and place them with bots.

But watch out! Loaded turrets have some tradeoffs:

Ammo is added ***1 second*** after the turret is placed. (Adjustable with mod setting.)

The recipe crafts quickly (0.5s) but ***consumes an electronic circuit***. (Think of it like you're jerry-rigging the brains of an inserter into the turret.) Make sure you bring enough circuits with you if you want to re-load your turrets a lot.
