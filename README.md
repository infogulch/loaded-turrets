*Loaded Turrets* adds recipes to create turrets with pre-filled ammo. This makes
it easier to perform turret creep, requiring less microing on the part of the
player to assault enemy bases.

This is pretty powerful, so in exchange it has a couple trade-offs:

1. Ammo is added 1 second after the turret is placed. A practiced player can do
   this faster. (Adjustable with mod setting.)
2. The recipe crafts quickly (0.5s) but burns an electronic circuit. (Think of
   it like you're jerry-rigging the brains of an inserter into the turret.) This
   means you have another resource to manage in an excursion away from your base.

There are two technologies: Loaded Turrets 1 and Loaded Turrets 2. The first
adds a recipe with 10 magazines. The second adds recipes for piercing magazines
and 20 magazine capacity.
