# Loaded Turrets -- Factorio Mod DEMO

> [!NOTE]
> This mod is a demo, is still in development, and is not yet published to the
> mod portal.

This mod adds recipes to create turrets with pre-filled ammo. This makes it
easier to perform turret creep, requiring less microing on the part of the
player to assault enemy bases.

This is pretty powerful, so in exchange it has some trade-offs:

1. Ammo is added 1 second after the turret is placed. A practiced player can do
   this faster.
2. The recipe crafts quickly (0.5s) but burns an electronic circuit. (Think of
   it like you're jerry-rigging the brains of an inserter into the turret.) This
   means you have another resource to manage in an excursion away from your base.
3. Requires Gun turret, Military 1, and Logistics as prerequisites, and uses
   logistic science packs to research.

There are two technologies: Loaded Turrets 1 and Loaded Turrets 2. The first
adds a recipe with 10 magazines. The second adds recipes for piercing magazines
and 20 magazine capacity.

## TODO

- Make it work with bots (currently bots just place regular turrets)
- Add technology and recipes for turrets loaded with uranium ammo
- Decide whether to add another capacity tier (50 magazines)
- Customize technology icons
- Customize name and description text for the items, recipes, and technologies
- Play with it to see if it's fun :)
- Tune the recipes and techs for balance and fun
