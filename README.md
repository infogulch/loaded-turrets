*Loaded Turrets* adds recipes to create turrets with pre-filled ammo. This makes
it easier to perform turret creep, requiring less microing to assault enemy
bases.

Loaded turrets are identical to normal gun turrets (except by name), and when
mined the result is a normal gun turret which is ready to be crafted into a
loaded turret again. This means you can use pick item on them (Q), blueprint
them, and place them with bots.

But watch out! Loaded turrets have some tradeoffs:

Ammo is added **1 second** after the turret is placed. A practiced player may be
able to do this faster manually. (Adjustable with mod setting.)

The recipe crafts quickly (0.5s) but **burns an electronic circuit**. (Think of
it like you're jerry-rigging the brains of an inserter into the turret.) Make
sure you bring enough circuits with you if you want to re-load your turrets a
lot.
